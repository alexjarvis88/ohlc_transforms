# ohlc_transforms
loads and OHLC .csv file and adds transformations for filtering, visualization and analysis.

In this example, the data was exported from TradingView.  But any .csv file with OHLC columns could be used.
The RSI and Volume are included because they are avilable from the TradingView export.
If those features are not available in your data, remove the associated transforms.
If other features are necessary, they can be added.
